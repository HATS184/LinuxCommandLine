# LinuxCommandLine (LCL)

This is a Linux Command Line simulater, where you can do ANYTHING you want, without breaking the computer!

Abbriviated LCL.


### Lisence

This is not licensed, my only wish is that you give credit to the owner of this (Ehsan Gaffori).

### Modules

List of modules needed:

1. os (for finding login name, preinstalled)
2. socket (for finding computer hostname, preinstalled)
3. webbrowser (for command nano, not preinstalled)

### Update Log

#### 11/01/2020, version 0.1.0

Made RaspberryPiCommandLine, incomplete.

#### 12/01.2020, version 0.1.1

Now dectects computer hostname as well as login so RaspberryPiCommandLine is MORE realistic!

Changed name to LinuxCommandLine beacuse it does not say raspberrypi as hostname.

Can detect false commands!

#### 13/01/2020, version 0.1.2

Made varibles.py to store varibles.

cd command works, version 0.1.0

#### 18/01/2020, version 0.1.3

cd command can now go backwards and forwards!

Abbriviated to LCL
