# LinuxCommandLine

This is a Linux Command Line simulater, where you can do ANYTHING you want, without breaking the computer!

### Update Log

#### 11/01/2020, version 0.1.0

Made RaspberryPiCommandLine, incomplete.

#### 12/01.2020, version 0.1.1

Now dectects computer hostname as well as login so RaspberryPiCommandLine is MORE realistic!

Changed name to LinuxCommandLine beacuse it does not say raspberrypi as hostname.

Can detect false commands!
